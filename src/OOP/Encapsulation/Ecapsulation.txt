The idea behind encapsulation is that you have a capsule or package so that there is no "direct"
access by the user to the fields of the class. In order to get and set the fields the user must go through
getters and setters -- functions that allow the user to get and set the field (e.g. getName() or setName() ).
The point of using getters and setters instead of directly setting the fields is that it protects the data from
invalid inputs. Think of the String name. An empty string is still a string but it makes no sense for
practical applications if the name of the object is empty. Therefore having a setter such as setName() and including
the logic to check for that essentially protects the data.
