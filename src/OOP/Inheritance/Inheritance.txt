Inheritance is a Java concept that is used to gives a child class the same
functionality as its' parent class plus more.

Let's say we have an imaginary class named food. The properties calorie, weight (in grams),
cost, etc is intrinsic to almost all food items. Lets say you have a subclass called manufactured goods.
Now manufactured goods is very very similar to food but has additional properties such as brand. Using
inheritance we can extend the food class to include branding in a new subclass called manufactured goods.

There are three different types of inheritance.
    - Single Inheritance is where one subclass inherits from one parent class
    - Multilevel Inheritance where one subclass inherits from a parent that inherits from a parent..
    so on and so forth
    - Hierarchical Inheritance is where a number of subclasses inherits from a single parent

Java doesn't support inheritance from multiple parents. That is a different feature called an Interface.
